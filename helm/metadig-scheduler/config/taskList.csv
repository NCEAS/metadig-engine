#   - harvest begin date: begin date: the first date to use for the DataONE 'listObjects' service
#   - harvest increment (days): increment (days): the time span for each search
#   - requestCount: the number of times to request from DataONE listObjects
#   - requestType: for score tasks, determine type of portal processing ("portal" or "node")

# Note: Portal harvesting for DataONE portals created on search.dataone.org will be performed on mnUCSB1, as MetacatUI sends create and
#       update requests performed on search.dataone.org to this host. We want to harvest them as soon as they are created, and not have to wait for mnUCSB1 to
#      sync to the CN, and then the CN index it, so the following entry is obsolete, and no longer used.

# Admin NOTE: it appears that DataONE HttpMultipartRestClient can't handle two clients being created at the same time, even if they are by different threads. This needs to be
#      investigated further and potentially a bug needs to be logged in github for this. Until then, an easy workaround is to ensure that no two tasks are started
#      at the same time, so adjust the cron schedule accordingly.
