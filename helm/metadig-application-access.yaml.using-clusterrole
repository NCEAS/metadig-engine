# The following Role and Rolebinding is needed for helm to get the IP address of the kube-dns service.
# This is used to create the DNS config for containers that overrides the default config. Once
# metadig has been upgraded so that a special DNS config is not required by containers, these can
# be removed. For details, see https://github.com/DataONEorg/k8s-cluster/issues/27
