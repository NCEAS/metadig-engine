    "description": "This dataset includes depth to water (m, from ground surface), water temperature (degrees C) and specific conductance (uS/cm) measurements from four monitoring wells at the Virginia Forest site (Brownsville) for the CZNet Coastal Cluster. Pressure, temperature and electrical conductivity were measured continuously in the field at 15\u002Dminute intervals with Solinst Levelogger 5 Model 3001s installed in each monitoring well. The Leveloggers were attached to a nylon cord and installed at the approximate depth of the well screen mid\u002Dpoint. Depth to water measurements were converted from Levelogger\u002Dmeasured pressure values. Pressure values were corrected for barometric pressure fluctuations and converted to depth to water values using reference manual depth to water measurements collected at the start and stop of each Levelogger deployment. No correction was done to the temperature values. Specific conductance values were calculated from Levelogger\u002Dmeasured electrical conductivity using the equation given by Standard Method 2510B. Between deployments, each Levelogger was submerged in a calibration solution with a known SC and the real\u002Dtime reading was recorded. If the real\u002Dtime reading was +/\u002D5% of the calibration solution concentration, the sensor was calibrated according to manufacturer specifications. SC values were adjusted for sensor drift by adding a correction factor to the sensor\u002Dmeasured value. Leveloggers were occasionally swapped between wells to allow for sensor maintenance and calibration. Because the Leveloggers were periodically stopped to download data before being redeployed, there may be gaps in the record between deployments.",
